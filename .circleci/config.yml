    #   If you break your build into multiple jobs with workflows, you will probably want to do the parts of this that are relevant in each
    # The following `checkout` command checks out your code to your working directory. In 1.0 we did this implicitly. In 2.0 you can choose where in the course of a job your code should be checked out.
    - checkout
    # Prepare for artifact and test results  collection equivalent to how it was done on 1.0.
    # In many cases you can simplify this from what is generated here.
